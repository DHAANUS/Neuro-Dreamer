## Overview

Neuro-Dreamer explores how **perceptual bias affects model-based reinforcement learning**.

This project compares two agents:

1. **Baseline Dreamer** using standard pixel observations
2. **Modified Dreamer with egocentric foveated perception**

The modified agent receives a **Gaussian-blurred observation**, where visual clarity is concentrated around the agent's location using `(xpos, ypos)` information from the environment.

This mimics **biological foveated vision**, where perception is sharp near the center of attention and blurred in the periphery.

The goal of the experiment is to evaluate whether **egocentric perception improves representation learning and policy learning in Dreamer agents**.

## Research Idea

Biological vision systems do not process every pixel with equal importance.
Humans rely on **foveated perception**, where the central region is high-resolution while peripheral vision is lower resolution.

Inspired by this principle, this project modifies the Dreamer observation pipeline by applying **spatially-aware Gaussian blur** centered on the agent's position.

This creates an **egocentric visual representation** that prioritizes local information.

---

## Experiment Setup

Two agents are trained and compared:

### Baseline Dreamer

* Standard visual input
* Raw environment frames
* No perceptual modification

### Neuro-Dreamer (Foveated)

* Observations blurred using **Gaussian blur**
* Blur intensity increases with distance from `(xpos, ypos)`
* Central region remains sharp
* Peripheral regions progressively blurred

This forces the model to prioritize **locally relevant information**.

---

## Foveated Observation Pipeline

Observation transformation:

```
Environment Frame
        ↓
Extract agent position (xpos, ypos)
        ↓
Apply spatial Gaussian blur
        ↓
Foveated observation
        ↓
Dreamer encoder
```

The encoder therefore learns representations from **attention-biased observations**.

---

## Architecture

The learning algorithm follows the **Dreamer model-based RL architecture**:

Components:

* Visual Encoder
* Recurrent State Space Model (RSSM)
* Reward Model
* Actor Network
* Critic Network

Training occurs using **latent imagination rollouts**.

---

## Environment

Environment: **Super Mario Bros**

Observations:

* RGB frames

Additional information used:

* Agent `(xpos, ypos)` from environment info

Action space:

* Discrete controller inputs

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DHAANUS/Neuro-Dreamer.git
cd Neuro-Dreamer
```

## Evaluation Metrics

Agent performance is evaluated using:

* Episode reward
* Learning speed

## Key Idea

Instead of changing the RL algorithm itself, this project studies **how modifying perception affects model-based learning**.

The hypothesis is that **egocentric perception may improve representation learning by removing irrelevant visual information**.

---

## Future Work

Possible extensions:

* Dynamic foveation radius
* Learned attention masks
* Multi-scale perception
* Comparison with attention-based encoders
* Extension to other environments
